# $@: The filename representing the target.
# $%: The filename element of an archive member specification.
# $<: The filename of the first prerequisite.
# $?: The names of all prerequisites that are newer than the target, separated by spaces.
# $^: The filenames of all the prerequisites, separated by spaces.
# $+: Similar to $^, this is the names of all the prerequisites separated by spaces, except that $+ includes duplicates.
# $*: The stem of the target filename. A stem is typically a filename without its suffix.
